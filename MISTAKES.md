# Mistakes log — things we tried that were bad

Append-only record of changes that landed in tree (or were attempted)
and turned out to be wrong, harmful, or otherwise misjudged. Each
entry exists so future rounds don't re-litigate the same idea on
incomplete information.

Format: date, what we tried, what went wrong, what the fix was, what
we learned. Newest at the top.

See `~/quakespasm/MISTAKES.md` for cross-applicable lessons from the
sister project — especially anything about benchmark concurrency
(don't run g3+g4 builds in parallel; don't run bench.sh legs
concurrently from one shell), and SDL framework dyld install_name
quirks.

## 2026-05-19 — `gl_dynamic 1` on GeForce2 MX (sawtooth) is a catastrophic regression

What we tried: as part of the "sawtooth visual unlock" round (the box has
50-60% fps headroom over the 60 fps playability floor), flipped the
autoexec from `gl_dynamic 0` to `gl_dynamic 1` along with several other
visual unlocks (`gl_picmip 0`, `gl_skymip 0`, `gl_round_down 0`,
`gl_texturemode GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR`, `gl_shadows 1`).

What went wrong: 83 fps → 15 fps demo1 1024×768. 95 fps → 15 fps at 640.
~80% regression — well below the 60 fps floor. Reverted to `gl_dynamic 0`
and the other changes were retained; FPS settled at 70/78 (~15-18% under
baseline, still comfortably above the floor).

What we learned: the **GeForce2 MX cannot afford per-frame lightmap
rebuild for dlight-touched surfaces**, regardless of fps headroom in
other dimensions. The chip's fixed-function lightmap-reblend path is
prohibitive: a single rocket light or muzzle flash forces a `glTexSubImage2D`
upload + a re-blend pass per affected surface, and demo1 has enough
dlights to stay in that path most of the frame. Cost is bandwidth on the
AGP bus, not fillrate. The original autoexec comment ("GeForce2 MX still
pays the lightmap-reblend cost; skip") was load-bearing. Don't try
`gl_dynamic 1` on sawtooth again without a fundamentally different
dlight code path (e.g. a subrect upload that uploads only the touched
columns — would help here even though it didn't help G3 where dlights
are already off).

Bench data: see commit immediately following this entry.

## 2026-05-19 — Lightmap subrect upload port is gated to the wrong machine

What we tried (or rather, was on the candidate list): port QS commit
294b8d03's `gl_lightmap_subrect` from `~/quakespasm/Quake/r_brush.c` to
yquake2 5.11's `src/refresh/r_lightmap.c:71`. QS audit predicted +4.2% on
demo1 1024 — enough to lift yosemite over the 20 fps floor.

What went wrong (before any code change): the QS audit overlooked that
yosemite's autoexec sets `gl_dynamic 0`, which gates the entire
`R_RenderLightmappedPoly` dynamic path in 5.11 (`r_surf.c:279/429/651`).
With dlights off, `LM_UploadBlock(true)` never fires — the subrect
optimization has nothing to optimize on yosemite.

What we learned: **per-machine autoexec settings change which code paths
are hot.** Phase B cherry-pick priorities derived from QS bench data
need to be re-checked against the corresponding Q2 autoexec before
deciding which machines benefit. The subrect upload IS still on the
table for the gl_dynamic=1 cohort (quicksilver / mini-g4 / mini-intel /
imac-2019) — and per the dlight regression above on sawtooth, it might
even unlock dlights on sawtooth.
